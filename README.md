# Air Quality Index With Deployment

Extracted the data from the web page 'https://en.tutiempo.net/climate/0{}-{}/ws-432950.html' using Python library requests, analysed the data , built different Machine Learning models and deployed the best fit model on Heroku using Flask.

Discriptive analytics like pre processing data, data visualizations, exploratory data analysis etc was performed on the data. Different machine Learning models like Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Linear Regression, Ridge and Lasso Regression and XGBoost Regression was built and evaluated using the matrics MSE, MAE, RMSE.

Best model was deployed using Flask and Heroku. The model predicts the air quality index of city Bangalore , India.
